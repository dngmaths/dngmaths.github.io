## Mathematical Modeling in Fluid Dynamics and Circulatory Disorders

Fluid mechanics has significant applications in understanding circulatory disorders such as stenosis and atherosclerosis. My research includes mathematical studies on arterial blood flow and the effects of external factors such as magnetic fields. For instance, the paper *Mathematical Analysis of an Atherosclerotic Artery in Presence of Externally Applied Magnetic Field* explores the impact of arterial hardening and plaque formation on oxygenated blood flow, combining mathematical modeling with fluid mechanics.

**Key Publications:**
- **Analysis of Fluid Dynamics Modelling Having Applications in Circulatory Disorders - A Mathematical Study** *(Bose et al., 2023)*
- **Mathematical Analysis of an Atherosclerotic Artery in Presence of Externally Applied Magnetic Field** *(Bose et al., 2022)*

## Blood Flow and Nanoparticle Transport in Capillaries

The dynamics of blood flow in capillaries provide insights into drug delivery mechanisms, including nanoparticle transport. My work employs a power-law fluid model to analyze the longitudinal transport of nanoparticles, integrating the physics of erythrocyte suspension in the blood core and plasma layer dynamics.

**Key Publication:**
- **Mathematical Model of Blood Flow through Capillaries to Study Transport of Nanoparticles Using Power Law Fluid Model** *(Mallik et al., 2022)*

## Stability Analysis in the Sitnikov Three-Body Problem

Astrophysical systems often exhibit complex gravitational interactions. I have contributed to analyzing the stability and periodicity of libration points in Sitnikov-type three-body problems, focusing on effects such as oblateness, radiation pressure, and perturbative forces.

**Key Publications:**
- **Stability and Periodicity in the Sitnikov Three-Body Problem When Primaries are Oblate Spheroids** *(Rahman et al., 2021)*
- **Stability of Collinear Libration Points in Photo-Gravitational Restricted Problems** *(Garain et al., 2015)*

## Historical and Analytical Studies in Mathematics

Exploring the historical development of mathematical concepts, my work connects ancient practices to modern methodologies. For example, studies on Aryabhata's projections and vinculum algebra reveal the evolution of calculation techniques and their logical frameworks.

**Key Publications:**
- **Improvement of the Rule of Aryabhata in the Case of Differences Between Two Projections of Consecutive Arc Divisions** *(Garain et al., 2021)*
- **Algebraic Representation of Vinculum and Generalized Rule for Vinculum Structure** *(Kumar et al., 2018)*

## Applied Physics and Mathematical Techniques

A significant focus of my research involves applying mathematical principles to solve problems in physics. Stability analysis, equilibrium point computation, and fuzzy logic applications highlight the interdisciplinary nature of my work.

**Key Publications:**
- **Effect of Perturbation in Coriolis and Centrifugal Forces in 2+2 Body Problem** *(Garain et al., 2013)*
- **Application of Inductive Method for the Concept of Fuzzy Set and Truth Functions in Fuzzy Logic** *(Garain et al., 2013)*
